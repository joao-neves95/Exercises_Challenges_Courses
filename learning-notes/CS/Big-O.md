# Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

## Asymptotic Notations

- [Mathematical] languages that allows for the analysis of an algorithm's running time.
- Done by **identifying its behavior** as the input size of the algorithm increases (the algorithm's growth rate).
- Types:
    - Best case
        - Not typically evaluated because the best case conditions are not really planned for.
    - Worst case
        - "Big-O", "O".
        - The most common way of analysis.
        - The ceiling (upper bound) growth for a given function.
        - Provides the *asymptotic upper bound* for the growth rate of the algo's runtime.
    - Average case
    - (etc.)
