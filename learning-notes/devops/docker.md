# Docker
- Open source platform/environment for developing, running and shipping applications.
- Separates the application (the code) from the infrastructure.
- It automates the deployment of applications, as portable and self sufficient containers.
- Good:
    - Reduce time to production.
    - Run anywhere.
- Concepts:
    - Image:
        - A static representation of the application, with its configuration and dependencies.
        - A lightweight, standalone executable package of software that includes everything that is needed to run the application.
        - Stored in a **registry**.
        - Instantiated to create a **container**.
    - Container:
        - A standard unit of software (image) that packages up the code and all its dependencies, that is running on the docker host.
    - The process of containerization:
        - Dockerfile
            - > build
        - Image
            - > run
        - Container
