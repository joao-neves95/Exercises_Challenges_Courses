# gRPC
- Synchronous backend microservice-to-microservice communication where immediate responses are required to continue processing.
- Polyglot environments, cross platform.
- **Low latency and high throughput communication**.
- Point-to-point real-time communication
    - Can push messages in real time without the need for pulling.
    - Support for bi-directional streaming.
- Network constrained environments
    - Binary gRPC messages are smaller compared to text-based JSON messages.
- Communication uses the HTTP/2 protocol + Protobuf (Protocol buffers).
- gRPC should be the primary choice for direct synchronous communication between microservices.
