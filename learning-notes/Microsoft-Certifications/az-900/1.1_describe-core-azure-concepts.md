# [Describe core Azure concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/)

## What is cloud computing

- The **delivery of computing services over the internet (cloud)**. I.e.: to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter.
- Services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence.
- Advantages: Faster innovation, efficiency, easier scalability, flexible resources, economics of scale.

## How does Azure work (high level)

- Azure uses **[virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)** to abstract separating the tight coupling between a computer's hardware and its OS.
- This abstraction layer is called an **hypervisor**.
- An **hypervisor** emulates all components and functionality of a computer on a VM.

## Main Types of Cloud Services <<

- Compute power
    - (Compute services).
    - VMs, web servers, Functions/serverless, Docker/containers, Kubernetes/clusters, etc.
- (Cloud) Storage
    - Blob storage for large objects like video files aor bitmaps, files storage, message queue storage, etc.
- Databases
    - SQL (SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL, Redis cache, etc.
- Web
    - App Hosting
    - Run Web Apps on a managed PaaS, notofication hubs, search as a service, etc.
- Networking
    - Linking compute resources and providing access to applications.
    - Secure connections, VPN connections to VMs, DNS, load balancing, firewall, DDoS protection, CDNs, etc.
- Integration
    - Logic Apps and Service Bus.
    - Connect applications and services.
- Analytics
    - Visualizing data telemetry, performance, etc.
- Identity
    - User authentication and protection.
- Big data
    - Work with large volumes of data.
- AI and ML
    - Forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.
    - Analyse data, text and speech, images and video (Vision), NLP, search, etc.
- IoT
    - Internet of Things.
    - Integrate, manage/control and monitor multiple sensors and devices.
- DevOps
    - Continuous integration (repositories, application tests, perform application monitoring), delivery, and deployment.

(Azure has over 100 services)

## The Azure free account includes:

### Free account

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to spend for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 25 products that are always free.

### Free student account

- Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.
- A credit to use in the first 12 months.
- Free access to certain software developer tools.

## Technological Benefits <<

- Scalable/**scalability**: increase or decrease resources and services as needed.
    - **Vertical scaling**: "**scaling up**", adding resources to increase the power of the existing server (RAM, CPU).
    - **Horizontal scaling**: "**scaling out**", adding more server/resource instances that function together as one unit.
- Elastic/**Elasticity**: (auto-scaling) automatically adding or removing resources, as workload spikes or drops.
- **Agility**: Deploy and configure resources as an application requirements change.
- **Geo-distribution**: Deploy applications and data to regional datacenters around the globe geographic distribution.
- **High availability**: the major cloud providers have data centers spread around the world. You can replicate your services into multiple regions around the world.
- **Fault Tolerance**: In case there is any fault in the application or infrastructure, the service can continue to work by moving the work to other healthy servers.
- **Disaster Recovery**: ensures that customers are not impacted when disaster occurs. Achieved with redundancy so if one component of the infrastructure fails, the backup takes place.
- It's secure: the major cloud providers have the highest standards to physical security. They also offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls.

## Business Benefits of the Cloud

- **Agility**: allows a business to deliver to customers faster.
- Consumption-based, **pay-as-you-go**, no upfront costs, pay only for what the user use.
- **Economies of scale**: the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost when operating at a larger scale.
   Big cloud providers can leverage economies of scale and pass the savings onto their customers.
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**
    - **CapEx**: (on-premises datacentre) spending money on physical infrastructure up front (upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time).
        - E.g: hardware, equipment, facilities, infrastructure, server, storage, network
    - **OpEx**: (cloud computing/services) spending money on services or products that a business is using now (no upfront cost).
    - Building a data center to start an online business requires a large upfront (hardware, equipment, facility/infrastructure) and ongoing (electricity, staff) capital investment.

## Types of cloud services models <<

- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service)
    - The **most flexible**, **gives the most control** over the provided hardware **to the user**.
    - Basically the user rents the hardware on the cloud provider's data center.
    - The closest to managing physical servers.
    - Requires the most user management. **Not hardware maintenance though**.
    - The cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but the OS and network maintenance is up to the cloud tenant.
    - E.g: IT infrastructure services, VMs, storage, operating systems.
    - Advantages:
        - No CapEx (no up-front costs).
        - Agility.
        - Flexibility (the most flexible cloud service).
        - No deep technical skills required.
        - Consumption-based model.
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service)
    - Provides the **managed hosting environment** for building, testing and deploying software applications. A complete development and deployment environment.
    - Users do not need to manage the underlying infrastructure. They don't need to install OS, web servers or updates.
    - The cloud provider has multiple resources as a service, which users can use on a pay-as-you-go basis.
    - E.g: Azure SQL Database, Azure App Services, etc.
    - Advantages (same as IaaS, plus):
        - Productivity (users only need to focus on application development).
    - Disadvantages:
        - Platform limitations (users are limited to the cloud platform services and features).
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service)
    - Are software/apps that are hosted on the cloud, and are developed and managed for the end customer.
    - Requires the least amount of management by the user. The user only needs to provide their data to the managed application.
    - E.g: Microsoft 365, Skype, Dynamics CRM Online, email, etc.
- **Serverless** computing:
    - Eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.
    - Highly scalable and event-driven.
    - Only uses resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

## Types of cloud computing (cloud deployment models) <<

- **Public cloud**
  - No local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date, **everything runs on the users cloud provider's hardware**.
  - Benefits:
      - Lower costs (no CapEx; no pay for hardware and software; pay-as-you-go model).
      - No maintenance (done by the service provider).
      - Near-unlimited scalability (on-demand resources).
      - High reliability (vast network of servers).
- **Private cloud**
  - The cloud environment is made **on-premises**, or hosted by a third-party service (i.e.: **dedicated host**).
  - Provides exclusive self-service access **solely to users of a specific business or organization**.
  - **Always maintained on a private network.**
  - Benefits:
      - More flexibility (the organization can customize its cloud environment for specific needs).
      - More control (resources are not shared with others; more control and privacy).
      - More scalability (compared to on-premises infrastructure).
- **Hybrid cloud**
  - **Combines public and private clouds**. Some servers are on the public cloud and others in their own on-premises data center.
  - Benefits:
      - Control (can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assests or workloads that require low latency).
      - Flexibility (take advantage of public cloud resources).
      - Cost-effectiveness (ability to scale to the public cloud; extra computing power on a pay-as-you-go model).
      - Ease (can migrate gradualy; phasing).
