### Intro

- AI is a category of computing that adapts and improves its decision-making ability over time, based on its successes and failures.
- The goal of AI is to adapt or learn something without being explicitly programmed to do it.
- Use case E.g.:
  - Product recommendations specific for a user, based on past sale data, from him or others who have purchased similar items.
  - Detect credit card fraud by analysing new transactions, based on past fraudulent transaction data.
- Two main AI approaches:
    - [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
      - Data science approach that uses existing data to train and test a model.
      - The model is then applied to new data, to forecast future behaviours, outcomes and trends.
    - [Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)
      - Modelled on the neural network of the human mind.
      - Discovers, learns and grows through experience.
- MSFT Azure provides multiple (3 primary) AI solutions, including tools, services, and programmatic APIs.

### Azure Machine Learning

- A platform for making **predictions**.
- Tools and services that allow to connect to data to train and test models, and find one that will most accurately predict a future result.
- For data scientists and AI engineers.
- Real time deployment via a web API endpoint.
- Uses:
  - Create data pipelines.
    - [Data Pipeline (atlan.com)](https://wiki.atlan.com/data-pipeline/)
    - [What Is a Data Pipeline? - DZone Big Data](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-a-data-pipeline)
    - (Define how to obtain data, handle missing or bad data, split it into multiple training or test sets, etc.)
  - Train and evaluate predictive models, with familiar tools and programming languages.
  - Deployment as an API endpoint, so it can be consumed in real time by other applications.
  - *Build a model with custom data, perform custom tasks, predict user behavior with custom/complex data.
  - *Predict future outcomes based on private historical data.

### Azure Cognitive Services

- Provides prebuilt (pre-trained) machine learning models.
- Used for *general purpose* problems.
- No ML or data science knowledge needed to use the services.
- Accessed via APIs.
- *Service categories (understand the content and meaning of):
  - Language ([NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing))
  - Speech (convert speech into text and text into natural-sounding speech, translation, speaker/voice verification and recognition)
  - Vision (picture, video, etc. recognition and identification)
  - Decision (personalized recommendations, content moderation, etc.)
- Use cases:
  - *Create a service that can understand the content and meaning of images, video, audio, or text translation.
  - **Azure Cognitive Services Personalizer** services - Predict user behaviour or provide users with personalized recommendations, as it identifies usage patterns.

### Azure Bot Service

- [Azure Bot Service ](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/bot-service/) and [Bot Framework ](https://dev.botframework.com/) are platforms for creating bots that understand and reply to questions like a human.
- Relies on other AI services.
- It exists pre-built no-code solutions (on Azure Marketplace, for e.g.), to create sophisticated bots.
- Different from Azure ML and Azure Cognitive Services because it has a specific use case (a communication bot).
- *Can be used to **quickly** help in simple and repetitive tasks, Q&A, **interactive chat experiences**, real-time translations, UX to access services, etc.
- *Interaction/conversation with humans through text, speech, by using **natural language processing**.
- Build a virtual agent that interfaces with humans via natural language.
