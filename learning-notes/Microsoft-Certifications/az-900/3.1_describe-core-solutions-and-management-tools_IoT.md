### Intro

IoT bridges the physical and digital worlds by enabling devices with sensors and and internet connection to communicate with cloud-based systems.
It enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analytics.
Colected data can also be combined with Azure AI services to make predictions.

#### Common sensors

- Environmental sensors for temperature and humidity levels.
- Barcode, QR code, (etc), scanners.
- Geo-location and proximity sensors.
- Light, color, infrared.
- Motion and touch.
- Accelerometer and tilt.
- Smoke, gas, alcohol.
- Mechanical sensors to detect anomalies.
- Flow, level, and pressure sensors.
