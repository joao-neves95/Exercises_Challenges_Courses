### Intro

IoT enables devices with sensors (physical world) and an internet connection to communicate with cloud-based systems (digital world).
With Azure IOT services it is possible to control/manage the multiple devices (to push updates, for e.g.), as well as monitorization.
It enables devices to gather and then relay information for data analytics.
Collected data can also be combined with Azure AI services to make predictions.

#### Common sensors

- Environmental sensors for temperature and humidity levels.
- Barcode, QR code, (etc), scanners.
- Geo-location and proximity sensors.
- Light, color, infrared.
- Motion and touch.
- Accelerometer and tilt.
- Smoke, gas, alcohol.
- Mechanical sensors to detect anomalies.
- Flow, level, and pressure sensors.

### Azure IoT Hub

- A managed cloud service that acts as the central message hub for bi-directional communication berween IoT apps and the devices it manages.
  (from device to the cloud and from the cloud to the device)
- Allows *command* and *control* (manual or automated remote control of the connected devices).
- Millions of IoT devices can communicate with each other.
- Supports multiple messaging patterns:
    - Device-to-cloud telemetry.
    - File upload from devices.
    - Request-reply methods for controlling devices from the cloud.

### Azure IoT Central

- Builds on to of IoT Hub.
- It adds a dashboard (UI) for collection, monitorization and management of the multiple IoT devices.
- IoT device remote control and visualization.
- Provides starter infrastructure templates for common scenarios.
- Provides device templates.
    - Device developers still need to create code to run on the devices, and that code must match the device template specification.

### [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sphere/)

- Creates an end-to-end, highly secure IoT solution.
- Includes enverything from the hardware and OS on the device, to the method of sending messages from device to the message hub.
- Components:
    - MCU
        - [Micro-controller unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller/)
            - Small integrated circuit computer.
        - Processes the OS system and signals from attached sensors.
        - MSFT offers multiple starter dev kits.
    - OS
        - Customized Linux OS.
    - Security Service (AS3)
        - Makes sure the device has not been maliciously compromised.
        - Manages the secure connection to Azure, using certificate-based authentication.
        - If successfully, checks if the device has been tampered with.
        - After the secure channel is established, it pushes OS or user-developed software updates.
