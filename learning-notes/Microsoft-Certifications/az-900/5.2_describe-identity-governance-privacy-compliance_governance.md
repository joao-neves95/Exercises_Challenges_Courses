### Intro

- *Governance* describes the general process of establishing rules and policies, ensuring that both are enforced.
- Helps maintaining control over all cloud resources.
- Ensure complience with:
    - Industry standards. E.g.: [PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-PCI-DSS).
    - Corporate/organizational standards. E.g.: ensuring that the network data is encrypted.
- Beneficial when an organization has:
    - Multiple engeneering teams in Az.
    - Multiple subscriptions to manage.
    - Regulatory requirements that must be enforced.
    - Standards that must be followed for all cloud resources.

### Strategies

---

- Ways to enforce standards while still enabling teams to create and manage the cloud resources they need.

#### **Azure role-based access control ([RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview))** <<

- Grant users only the rights they need to perform their job, and only to relevant resources.
- Can be applied to an individual person or to a group.
- The access permissions are managed on the Acess control (IAM) pane in the Azure portal.
- Azure provides built-in roles that describe common access rules.
   It's also possible to define custom roles. Each role has a set of permissions.
   Individuals or groups can be assigned to one or more roles, receiving the associated access permissions.
- RBAC is applied to a *scope*.
    - Scope: resource or set/group of resources that this access applies to.
    - **Scopes can be**:
        |- A management group (collection of multiple subscriptions).
        |- A single subscription.
        |- A resource group.
        |- A single resource.
    - Types of roles:
        - Owner:
            - At the management group scope => can manage everything in all subscriptions within the management group.
        - Reader:
            - On a group at the subscription scope => the members can view every resource group and resource within the subscription.
        - Contributor:
            - To an application at the resource group scope => the app can manage all resources within that resource group, but not other resouce groups whitin the subscription.

![RBAC - Roles](../../../_assets/RBAC_roles.png)

- **When to use** (needs; e.g.):
    - Allow one user to manage VMs in a subscription and another user to manage VNets.
    - Allow a DBA group to manage SQL DBs in a subscription.
    - Allow a user to manage all resource in a resource group (e.g.: VMs, websites, subnets, etc.).
    - Allow an app to access all resources in a resource group.
- How is it enforced:
    - Enforced on any action on a resource that passes through Azure Resource Manager.
        - Resource Manager is a services that provides a way to organize and secure cloud resources.
    - Doesn't enforce access permissions at the application or data level.
    - Uses *allow model*. *Allows* a user/group/app to perform certain actions.

---

####  **Resource locks** <<

- A [resource lock](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources?tabs=json) prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.
- Even with RBAC, there's still risk that people with the right level of access cloud delete critical resources.
- Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions, even owners.
- How can RL be managed:
    - From the Azure portal, **Settings** pane section of any resource.
- Lock targets:
    - Subscriptions.
    - Resource groups.
    - Individual resources.
- **Lock levels**:
    - **CanNotDelete**
        - Possible: authorized users can *read* and *modify* resource.
        - Not possible: *delete* the resource <u>without first a lock removal</u>.
    - **ReadOnly**
        - Possible: authorized users can *read* a resource.
        - Not possible: *delete* or *modify*/change a resource.
- Azure Blueprints
    - Can be combined with resource locks.
    - Enables to define the set of resources that an organization requires (e.g.: define a blueprint that specifies that a certain resource lock must exist).

---

####  **Tags** <<

- For resource organization.
- Can help understand cloud usage, cost management, security (e.g: levels), governance and regulatory compliance, optimization and automation.
- An alternative to organizing related resources by a common subscription.
- Tags provide extra information/metadata about the resources.
- How to manage:
    - Add, modify or delete through PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager templates, RestAPI, Azure portal.
    - Azure Policy.

---

####  **Azure Policy** <<

- Ensures that resources on a subscription stay compliant.
- Create, assign and manage policies (rules and effects) that control or audit resources.
- It then evaluates resources and highlights the ones that aren't complient with the policies.
- Can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.
- Has multiple built-in policy and initiative definitions.
- Types of policies:
    - Individual (**definitions**).
    - Groups of related policies (**initiatives**).
        - A way of grouping related policies into one set.
        - All the policy definitions to track the compliance state for a larger goal.
        - Like a policy assignment, an initiative assignment is an initiative definition that's assigned to a specific scope.
- It integrates with Azure DevOps by applying CI/CD pipeline policies that are applied pre-deployment and post-deployment.
- Steps to create one:
    1. Create a policy definition.
        - Expresses what to evaluate and what action to take.
        - E.g.: Prevent VMs from being deployed in certain regions.
    2. Assign the definition to resources.
        - A *policy assignement* is a policy definition that takes place whithin a specific scope.
        - PAs are inherited by all child resources withn that scope.
    3. Review the evaluation results.
        - Policy evaluation happens about once per hour.
- How/where to define:
    - Azure portal or CLI tools.

---

#### **Azure Blueprints** <<

- Enables to define a repeatable set (I.e. blueprint) of governance tools and standard Azure resources.
- Blueprints are versioned.
- Orchestrates the deployment of various **resource templates** and other **artifacts**, like:
    - Role assignements.
    - Policy assignements.
    - Azure Resource Manager templates.
    - Resource groups.
- Steps of creation:
    1. Create an Azure Blueprint.
    2. Assign the blueprint.
    3. Track the blueprint assignments.
- The relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignement (what was deployed) is preserved/persisted.
- Blueprint artifact: each component in the blueprint definition.

#### Create a subscription governance strategy

- Identiry a cloud organization structure that meets the business needs.
- Form a *cloud center of excellence team*.
- Teams often start their Azure governance strategy at the subscription level:
    1. Billing
        - Create one billing report per subscription.
        - Organize subscriptions by department or by project.
        - Resource tags can help.
    2. Access control
        - A subscription is a deployment boundary for Azure resources.
        - Every subscription is associated with an Azure Active Directory tenant.
        - Each tenant provides administrators the ability to set granular access through defined roles by using Azure role-based access control.
    3. Subscription limits
        - Subscription limits should be considered during the design phase.
