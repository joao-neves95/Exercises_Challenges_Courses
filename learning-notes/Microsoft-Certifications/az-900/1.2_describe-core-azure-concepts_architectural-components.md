## *Azure Resource Hierarchy Levels

![azure-resource-hierarchy-levels](../../../_assets/azure-resource-hierarchy-levels.png)

- **Resources**: The instances of services that a user creates (VMs, SQL databases, etc.).
- **Resource groups**: Resources are combined into resource groups, that form a logical container.
- **Subscriptions**: Groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those accounts.
- **Management groups**: Helps manage access, policy and compliance for multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.

### Subscriptions

![Diagram showing Azure subscriptions using authentication and authorization to access Azure accounts.](../../../_assets/subscriptions.png)

- A logical unit of Azure services that links to an Azure account.
- Provides a user with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services.
- An account can have multiple subscriptions, that have different billing models and access-management policies.
- Users can use them to create boundaries around products, services and resources.
- Types of subscription boundaries:

  - Billing
    - Determines how an account is billed.
  - Access control
    - Access-management policies at the subscription level.
- You might choose to create additional subscriptions to separate:

  - Environments
    - E.g.: Development, testing, production, or isolate access control for compliance reasons.
  - Organizational structures
    - E.g: Limit a team to lower-cost resources, but allow the IT department a full range.
  - Billing
    - Because they are all aggregated, separate subscriptions based on needs.
    - E.g: a subscription for production workloads and another for development and testing.

### Management groups

- Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions.

- All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions from the management group.

- You can provide user access to multiple subscriptions, creating role-based access control.

- E.g.: Apply policies to a management group that limits the regions available for VM creation. This policy would be applied to everything under that management group.

- Important facts about management groups
  - 10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
  - A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
  - Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.
  - Each management group can have many children.
  - All subscriptions and management groups are within a single hierarchy in each directory.

### Resources and Resource Manager

- Resource
  - A manageable item that's available on Azure.
  - E.g.: VMs, storage accounts, web apps, DBs, etc.
- Resource group
  - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.
  - All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only ve a member of a single resource group.
  - If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted.
  - Logical grouping is placing resources of similar usage, type, or location in a resource group, to provide order and organization all the resources.
  - Authorization: resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions.
- *Azure Resource Manager
  - Is the deployment and management service for Azure, that enables you to create, update and delete resources in your Azure account.
  - Provides a common platform for deploying objects to a cloud infrastructure and for implementing consistency across the Azure environment.  
  - Benefits:
    - Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates instead through scripts. A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
    - Deploy, manage and monitor all resources as a group, rather than individually.
    - Define the dependencies between resources.
    - Apply access control to all services.
    - Apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources.

## Regions

- Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe.
- A *region* is a geographical area that contains at least one datacenter.
- **Some services or VM features are only available in certain regions.**
- **There are some global Azure services that don't require a particular region selection. E.g.: Azure Active Directory, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS**
- Regions gives a user the flexibility to bring applications closer to its users no matter they are. This improves better scalability and redundancy.

### Availability zones

- Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within the same Azure region.
- Is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one goes down, the other continues to work.
- They are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
- Run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture.
- Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.
- Availability zones fall into two categories:
  - Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone.
  - Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones.

### Region pair

- Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away.
- Allows for the replication of resources (such as VM storage) across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect both regions at once.
- Because the pair of regions is directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional disasters, you can use them to provide reliable services and data redundancy.

# [Azure terminology and concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/exercise-create-website)

## App Service

- PaaS.
- An HTTP-based service that enables building and hosting web-based solutions without managing infrastructure.
- Windows- and Linux-based environments are available.

## Azure Marketplace

- Online store that hosts applications certified to run in Azure.
- From AI an ML, to web apps.
- E.g.: WordPress.
