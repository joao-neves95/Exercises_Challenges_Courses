## Azure ExpressRoute fundamentals

- A connectivity provider that enables the extention of on-promisis networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection.

- Possible to establish connections to MSFT cloud services, such as Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365.

- Connections don't travel over the public internet.

- *Types of connectivity:
- Any-to-any (IP VPN) network
  - Point-to-point Ethernet network
  - Colocation at a cloud exchange. Virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility.
  
- This unit focuses on two different layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model

  - Extra resources to learn more about the OSI model:

    - [What is OSI Model | 7 Layers Explained | Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/osi-model/)

  - Layer 2 (L2)

    - The Data Link Layer.
    - Provides node-to-node communication between two nodes on the same network.
    - Defines format of data on the network.

  - Layer 3 (L3)

    - The Network Layer.

    - Provides addressing and touting between nodes on a multi-node network.

    - Decides which phisical path the data will take.

### Features and benefits:

  - Layer 3 connectivity between on-premises network and the MSFT Cloud (through a connectivity provider).
  - Built-in redundancy.
      - Each connectivity provider uses redendant devices to ensure high availability.
    - All redundant connections are configured with L3 connectivity.
  - Connectivity to MSFT services across all regions in the geopolitical region
  - Global connectivity to MSFT services across all regions with the ExpressRoute premium add-on.
  - Dynamic routing on-premises net and MSFT via GBP.
  - Connection uptime SLA.
  - QoS support for Skype for Business.

### Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services

- Microsoft Office 365
- Microsoft Dynamics 365
- Azure compute services (E.g.: VMs)
- Azure clolud services (E.g.: Az Cosmos DB, Az Storage)
