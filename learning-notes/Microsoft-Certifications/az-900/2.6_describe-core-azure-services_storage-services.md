## Azure Storage Services

### Accounts

- To begin using Azure Storage, you first need to create an Azure Storage account.
- The account provides a unique namespace that contains all the data objects, such as blobs, files and disks.
- Azure VMs use Azure Disk Storage to store virtual disks.
- Data accessible with HTTP and [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).

### Azure Blob Storage

- Object cloud storage. [Unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data), no data model or organization in a pre-defined manner. [Blob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object).
- Types of data include: text, binary (image, video, audio, etc.).
- Good for:
  - Streaming data.
  - Concurrent uploads.
  - Storing backups.
  - Storing up to 8TB of data for VMs.
- Blobs are stored in containers.

  #### Blob access tiers:

  To manage costs, it's helpful to organize data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period.

  - Hot access tier: optimized for frequent access (e.g.: images for a website).
  - Cool access tier: Optimized for infrequent access and data stored for at least 30 days.
  - Archive access tier: For data rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days (e.g.: long-term backups).

  Considerations:

  - Only hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level-
  - Hot, cool and archive tiers can be set at the blob level, during or after upload.
  - Data in the cool access tier can have a slightly lower availability service-level agreement (SLA), higher access costs and lower storage costs, compared to hot data (trade-off).

### Azure Disk Storage

- Provides disks for VMs.
- Data is persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.
- Options include: [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive)s, traditional [HDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)s, with varying performance tiers.

### Azure Files Storage

- Fully managed file shares, accessible vie the industry standard [Server Message Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block), or [Network File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), communication protocols.
- Can be concurrently mounted on the cloud or on on-premises deployments (Windows, Linux and macOS).
- Azure Files ensures data is encrypted at rest, and the SMB protocol ensures encryption in transit.
- Users can share and access files through a URL that points to the file, with a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token to restrict access
- Good for:
  - On-premises applications that use file shares.
  - Store configuration files (for dev tools and utilities) and access the same version from multiple VMs.
  - Write, process and analyse data (e.g.: diagnostic logs, metrics, crash dumps).
