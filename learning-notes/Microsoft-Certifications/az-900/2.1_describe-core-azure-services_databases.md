## Azure Databases

### *Azure Cosmos DB

- Globally distributed, multi-model database service.
- It's possible to elastically and independently scale across multiple regions worldwide.
- Schema-less data (NoSQL), atom-record-sequence (ARS) format, which is then abstracted and projected as an API for SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin API (graph-based), etc.
- Works with different data models from a variety of popular APIs.

### Azure SQL Database

- Relational database.
- Based on the latest stable version of SQL Server' engine.
- Is a managed PaaS database engine, so the user does not need to manage the infrastructure.
- It can process relational and non-relational structures, such as graphs, JSON, XML, etc.
- The Microsoft Data Migration Assistant can be used for database migration. It generates assessment reports, recommendations and the migration itself.

### Azure Database for MySQL

- Relational database, PaaS.
- Based on MySQL Community Edition.
- Popular with the [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) stack.
- Benefits compared to on-premises:
  - Built-in high availability.
  - Predictable performance and pay-as-you-go pricing.
  - Scale as needed (scalability).
  - Sensitive data protection.
  - Automatic backups.
  - Enterprise-grade security and compliance.

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL

- Relational database, PaaS.
- Based on the community version of PostgreSQL.
- Benefits compared to on-premises:
  - High availability.
  - Flexible pricing and performance based on the pricing tier.
  - Scale up/down as needed. Dynamic scaling.
  - Configurable automatic backups.
  - Enterprise-grade security (encryption on disk and SSL communication).
- Deployment options:
  - Single server.
  - Hyperscale (Citus)
    - Scales queries (distributed queries) across multiple machines by using [sharding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sharding).
- Pricing tiers:
  - Basic.
  - General Purpose.
  - Memory Optimized.

### Azure Synapse Analytics

- Analytics service that brings enterprise data warehousing and bid data analytics together.
- Query data by using serverless or provisioned resources.
- Unified service to ingest, prepare, manage and serve data for BI and ML needs.

### Azure HDInsight

- Analytics service for enterprises.
- Open-source.
- Fully managed.
- For massive amounts of data.

### Azure Databricks

- Unlock insights from big data and build artificial intelligence solutions.

### Azure Data Lake Analytics

- On-demand analytics job service to extract valuable insights from big data.
