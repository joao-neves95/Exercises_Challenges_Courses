## Azure VPN Gateway fundamentals

- [Virtual private network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network).
- **Type of private interconnected network**.
- They use an encrypted tunnel and typically connect multiple trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (the public Internet).
- All transferred data is encrypted in a private tunnel as it crosses the Internet.

### VPN Gateways

- A VPN gateway is a type of network gateway.
- Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed in Azure Virtual Network instances.
- **You can only deploy one VPN gateway in each VNet, but you can use one gateway to connect to multiple locations, which includes other VNets or on-premises datacenters**.
- *They enable the following connectivity:
  - On-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a ***site-to-site*** connection.
  - Individual devices to VNs through a ***point-to-site*** connection.
  - VNs to other VNs through a ***network-to-network*** connection.
- Types of VPNs:
  - Policy-based:
    - Statically specify the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel.
    - Only supports [IKEv1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Key_Exchange).
    - The source and destination of the tunned networks are statically declared in the policy and don't need to be declared in routing tables.
    - Used for specific scenarios, such as for **compatibility with legacy on-premises VPN devices**.
  - Route-based:
    - [IPSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface.
    - IP routing, with static or [dynamic routing protocols](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-dynamic-routing), routes each packet to the right tunnel interface.
    - Supports IKEv2.
    - Preferred connection for on-premises devices.
    - Uses any-to-any ([wildcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record)) traffic selectors.
    - Can use dynamic routing protocols, where routing tables direct traffic to different IPSec tunnels.
      - In this case, the source and destination networks aren't statically defined, like in policy-based, and data packets are encrypted based on network [routing tables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/routing-tables-in-computer-network/) with protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
    - Used for:
      - Connections between VNets.
      - Point-to-site connections.
      - Multisite connections.
      - Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway.

### VPN Gateway sizes

  - The capabilities of the VPN depends on the SKU or size that is deployed.

| SKU                  | Site-to-site/Network-to-network tunnels | Aggregate throughput benchmark | Border Gateway Protocol support |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Basic (for Dev/Test) | Maximum: 10                             | 100 Mbps                       | Not supported                   |
| VpnGw1/Az            | Maximum: 30                             | 650 Mbps                       | Supported                       |
| VpnGw2/Az            | Maximum: 30                             | 1 Gbps                         | Supported                       |
| VpnGw3/Az            | Maximum: 30                             | 1.25 Gbps                      | Supported                       |

### Azure VPN Gateway requirements for deployment

- Azure resources:
  - Virtual network
    - It must have enough address space for the additional subnet for the VPN gateway.
    - Only one VPN gateway per VNet.
  - GatewaySubnet
    - The subnet for the VPN gateway.
    - Use at least a /27 address mask, to make sure there are enough IP addresses in the subnet for future growth.
  - Public IP address
    - Provided with the Basic-SKU dynamic public IP address, for non-zone-aware gateways. This address is dynamic, but it won't change unless you delete the VPN gateway.
  - Local network gateway
    - To define the on-premises network configuration, such where the VPN gateway will connect and what it will connect to.
    - The configuration is used by the VPN gateway to route packets that are destined for on-premises networks through the IPSec tunnel.
  - Virtual network gateway
    - To route traffic between the VNet and the on-premises datacenter or other virtual networks.
    - It can be a VPN or an ExpressRoute gateway.
  - Connection
    - Creates a logical connection between the VPN gateway and the local network gateway.
    - It's possible to create multiple connections.
    - The connection is made:
      - *To* the on-premisses VPN device's IPv4 address, as defined by the local net gateway.
      - *From* the VNet gateway and its associated public IP address.

- On-premises resources:
  - VPN device that supports policy-based or route-based VPN gateways.
  - Public-facing (Internet-routable) IPv4 address.

### High-availability configuration scenarios

- Active/standby
  - When the active connection is disrupted, the standby instance automatically assumes responsibility.
- Active/active
  - Each instance has a unique public IP address.
  - They function on separate tunnels.
- ExpressRoute failover
- Zone-redundant gateways.
