## C# / .NET

### Personal Projects

- [Coinelity](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Coinelity)

  A binary options trading platform is C# ASP.NET, SignalR, Node.js, SQL Server and a frontend vanilla JavaScript with an MVC pattern, CCXT, eCharts.js.\
  This was supposed to be my final year school project, however, as per advice of my school mentor, this project was dropped for not having enough graphic design.

- [Braces](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Braces):

  (This project was abandoned and it's not finished)\
  More than a code editor. It is a specification for code editors.\
  The API communication is done through SignalR (WebSockets).\
  The idea was to create a bridge between code editors/IDEs and plugins/extensions, in order for developers be able to use any plugin/extension from/in any code editor/IDE.\
  It is made in C# .NET Core and the plugins/extension run in the PluginHost inside a Docker container.

## C++

- [Blockchain](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/C%2B%2B/Blockchain):

  A basic blockchain with block mining. It uses an hybrid Proof of Work algorithm that includes Argon2d hashing - RAM instensive; maximizes resistance to GPU and ASIC's cracking attacks - and a SHA256 PoW - GPU:<br/>
  `SHA256( Argon2d( blockData ) + blockData.nounce )`<br/>
  To find the block's nounce**s**, the miner must do the two hashes until he reaches the desired target bits. The difficulty increments the Argon2d memory requirements.<br/>
  The persistence of blocks is made through LevelDB.
  Currently there is no server implementation nor transactions, the idea was to understand what Proof of Work is.<br/>

  as well as simple ones like farm and dump hyper-inflationary farms.
  This is just a copy from master of a private repository, so do not consider it as up to date.
  It is used in production.
