- [Tutorials](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Personal-Projects/Tutorials)

### Personal Projects

 - [Amplifir](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Amplifir):

A Twitter implementation in .NET Core 3+ and Angular 8+, using DRY, Onion Architecture/Clean Architecture and some Domain Driven Design principles.

 - [ClassStudio](https://github.com/joao-neves95/ClassStudio):

A code generation tool with a desktop GUI in Electron.NET and a backend in .NET 5.
It is capable of generating multiple code conversions.

 - [RegexQuery](https://github.com/joao-neves95/RegexQuery)

Regular expressions in english. Create regular expression in an idiomatic way.
Made with C#, with object oriented APIs for .NET, JavaScript and Typescript.

 - [CSharpToTypescript](https://github.com/joao-neves95/CSharpToTypescript)

Fork maintenance of a C# to TypeScript converter, modified and adapted to migrate to .NET Standard 2.0 and compile with Visual Studio 2019.

 - [Braces](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Braces):

 More than a code editor. It is a specification for code editors.
 An API communicating through SignalR (WebSockets).
 The idea is to create a bridge between code editors/IDEs and plugins/extensions,
 in order for developers be able to use any plugin/extension in any code editor/IDE.
 It is made in .NET Core 3 and plugins/extension run in the PluginHost inside a Docker container.

## C++

- [Blockchain](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/C%2B%2B/Blockchain):

A basic blockchain with block mining. It uses an hybrid Proof of Work algorithm that
includes Argon2d hashing - RAM instensive; maximizes resistance to GPU and ASIC's
cracking attacks - and a SHA256 PoW - GPU intensive:<br/>
```SHA256( Argon2d( blockData ) + blockData.nounce )```<br/>
The persistence of blocks is made through LevelDB.
Curently there is no server nor transactions.<br/>
To find the block's nounce**s**, the miner must do the two hashes until he reaches the desired target bits. The difficulty increments the Argon2d memory requirements.<br/>
