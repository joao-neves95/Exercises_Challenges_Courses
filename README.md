## Node.js

### Personal Projects

- [PortfolioOS](https://github.com/joao-neves95/portfolio-os)
  
  A social network for programmers, that simulates an operative system with a fully interactive and dynamic desktop.
  Users can make their own apps and integrate them on the OS.
  The frontend was made with pure vanilla JavaScript ES8+ with different patterns, inckuding MVC.
  The server was made on Node.js with Express.js.
  The databese is PostgreSQL and it was normalized.

## C# / .NET

- [Tutorials](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/CSharp/Personal-Projects/Tutorials)

### Personal Projects

 - [ClassStudio](https://github.com/joao-neves95/ClassStudio):
 
A code generation tool with a desktop GUI in Electron.NET and a backend in .NET Core 3.0.
It is capable of generating multiple code conversions.

 - [Braces](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Braces):
 
 More than a code editor. It is a specification for code editors.
 An API communicating through SignalR (WebSockets).
 The idea is to create a bridge between code editors/IDEs and plugins/extensions,
 in order for developers be able to use any plugin/extension in any code editor/IDE.
 It is made in .NET Core 3.

### Courses

## C++

- [Blockchain](https://github.com/joao-neves95/Exercises_Challenges_Courses/tree/master/C%2B%2B/Blockchain):

A basic blockchain with block mining. It uses an hybrid Proof of Work algorithm that
includes Argon2d hashing - RAM instensive; maximizes resistance to GPU and ASIC's
cracking attacks - and a SHA256 PoW - GPU intensive:<br/>
```SHA256( Argon2d( blockData ) + blockData.nounce )```<br/>
The persistence of blocks is made through LevelDB.
Curently there is no server nor transactions.<br/>
To find the block's nounce**s**, the miner must do the two hashes until he reaches the desired target bits. The difficulty increments the Argon2d memory requirements.<br/>
