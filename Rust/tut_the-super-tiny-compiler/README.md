# The Super Tiny Compiler - Rust Edition

A super tiny Lisp compiler written in Rust.

I've had previously made a very crude compiler ([MergerJS](https://github.com/joao-neves95/merger-js)).
This one however, was done by following a compiler tutorial in JavaScript,
in order to actually know how to do one properly.
