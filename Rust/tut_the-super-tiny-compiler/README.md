# The Super Tiny Compiler - Rust Edition

## The Super Tiny Lisp-Rust Compiler

A super tiny Lisp to Rust compiler written in Rust.

I've had previously made a very crude compiler ([MergerJS](https://github.com/joao-neves95/merger-js)).\
This one, however, was done by following and further building upon a compiler tutorial in JavaScript, in order to actually know how to properly do one.
